 Define a function to evaluate the score of a game state 
def evaluate(state): 
    # This function should return a score that represents how good the state is for the current 
player 
    # A positive score means the current player is winning, and a negative score means the 
current player is losing 
 
# Define the Minimax algorithm function 
def minimax(state, depth, player): 
    # If the game is over or the maximum depth has been reached, return the score of the 
current state 
    if depth == 0 or game_over(state): 
        return evaluate(state) 
     
    # If it's the current player's turn, maximize their score 
    if player == "X": 
        best_score = float('-inf') 
        for move in get_possible_moves(state): 
            new_state = make_move(state, move, player) 
            score = minimax(new_state, depth - 1, "O") 
            best_score = max(best_score, score) 
        return best_score
      # If it's the other player's turn, minimize their score 
    else: 
        best_score = float('inf') 
        for move in get_possible_moves(state): 
            new_state = make_move(state, move, player) 
            score = minimax(new_state, depth - 1, "X")
